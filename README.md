# Predictive Modeling for Hospital Readmission

This project demonstrates a simple yet effective **predictive modeling workflow** to identify patients at risk of hospital readmission. It focuses on applied **health informatics and data science** skills, including clinical data preparation, logistic regression modeling, and evaluation using ROC-AUC metrics.

---

## Project Overview

Hospital readmissions are costly and often preventable. By leveraging logistic regression, this project predicts the likelihood of readmission based on patient-level clinical and demographic data.  
The model provides a foundation for understanding how predictive analytics can improve healthcare decision-making and patient outcomes.

## Objective

To build and evaluate a **logistic regression model** that predicts whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital based on key demographic and clinical features.  
This type of predictive modeling supports hospital administrators and care teams in identifying high-risk patients for targeted interventions.

## Dependencies

Install the required Python packages before running the project:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

---

## How to Run the Project

1. **Navigate to the scripts folder:**
   ```bash
   cd predictive_model_project/scripts
   ```

2. **Run the predictive model:**
   ```bash
   python predictive_model.py
   ```

3. **The script will automatically:**
   - Load the dataset from `../data/readmission_clean_simple.csv`  
   - Encode categorical variables  
   - Split data into training and testing sets  
   - Train a logistic regression model  
   - Evaluate model performance (accuracy, AUC, and classification report)  
   - Display and save the ROC curve to `../visualizations/roc_curve.png`

## Notes

- The dataset (`readmission_clean_simple.csv`) was pre-cleaned from a larger hospital readmission dataset prior to modeling.  
- The logistic regression model is intentionally simple and interpretable.  
- This project showcases skills in **data preprocessing, feature encoding, supervised learning, and model evaluation**—all essential in health informatics and applied machine learning.

---

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate additional models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for comparison  
- Automate evaluation reports and metric saving  
- Explore feature importance for explainability  
- Add socio-economic or behavioral data to enhance prediction accuracy
